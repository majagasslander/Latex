\section{Problem Formulation}
The aim of this thesis is to evaluate methods to segment satellite images into cloud and non-cloud pixels, and compare the result to Vricon's inhouse methods. Different combinations of existing methods for feature extraction and classification will be evaluated.

\section{Approach}
A preliminary approach for solving the task is to divide the problem into several smaller problems. Each subproblem is described in more detail in the subsections below. The pipeline can be seen in figure \ref{fig:pipeline} below.

\subsection{Data}
The images that will be used for cloud classification in this thesis is both panchromatic high resolution images, and also an eight-band multispectral imagery, containing various types of landscape and cloud amount. All images will be provided by Vricon. These images will be used to create feature vectors of training data.

\subsection{Pre processing}
To make the classification easier the images are pre processed. This will be done by tiling the images into smaller tiles. An alternative to tiling is to do a superpixel segmentation that will be taken into consideration. Also, a histogram equalization will be applied. This will flatten the greylevel histogram of the image so that all intensities are as equal as possible and thereby the image contrast is increased.

%\subsubsection{Tiling}
%First the image $I$ is divided into smaller tiles, $I_k$. To avoid wrong classification in the tiles containing cloud boundaries, overlapping tiles is used. 

%\subsubsection{Edge detection}
%Since clouds contains very little sharp edges, many of the non-cloud tiles can be sorted away by calculating the edges with the canny edge detector \citep{canny}.

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
After the pre processing is done it is time to perform the feature extraction. A good feature clearly seperates the two classes from each other. Texture and color are the two features that will recieve the biggest focus in this master thesis. Some suggestions for features extractions to test are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Gabor Filters: \\
A set of Gabor filters with different frequencies and orientation might be good to extract  texture features from the clouds.
The equation for a complex Gabor filter looks like follows:
\begin{equation}
g(x, y; \lambda, \theta, \psi, \sigma, \gamma) = e^{-\frac{x'^2 + \gamma^2y'^2}{2\sigma^2}}e^{i(2\pi\frac{x'}{\lambda} + \psi)}
\end{equation}
where \\
$x' = x\cos\theta + y\sin\theta$ \\
and \\
$y' = -x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta$

\item Homogeneous Texture Descriptor: \\
Clouds have a very homogeneous texture, so the Homogeneous Texture Descriptor (HTD) might be good to extract texture features in the clouds. It is based on computing the local spatial-frequency statistics of the texture.

\item Grey level co-occurrence matrix: \\
A grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is a histogram of co-occurring greyscale values at a given offset over an image. The GLCM functions characterize the texture of an image by calculating how often pairs of pixels with specific values and in a specified spatial relationship occur in an image.

\item Color: \\
Since the clouds often differ in color compared to other areas with simliar texture (for example water) it might be good to use color as an feature for the classification. 
\end{itemize}
Additional features that is discovered during the work might be tested as well.

\subsection{Classification}
For the classification Support Vector Machines (SVM) will be uesd. SVM is a supervised learning method. 
Consider a set of \textit{training} vectors $ \textbf{x}_{i}, i = 1,...,k $, which are the feature vectors, and the corresponding vector $ \textbf{y} $ of length $ k $ containing the class values; 

\begin{equation}
y_{i} =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if $\textbf{x}_{i}$ in class 1} \\
-1,
& \text{if $\textbf{x}_{i}$ in class 2}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Then we have the separating hyperplane as $\textbf{w}^{T}\textbf{x} + b = 0$

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hyp}
\begin{cases}
(\textbf{w}^{T}\textbf{x}_{i}) + b > 0 & \text{if $y_{i} = 1$} \\
(\textbf{w}^{T}\textbf{x}_{i}) + b < 0 & \text{if $y_{i} = -1$}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The decision function then becomes $f(\textbf{x}) = sgn(\textbf{w}^{T}\textbf{x} + b)$, where $ \textbf{x} $ is the testdata. There are many possible choices for $\textbf{w}$ and $b$.
Equation \ref{eq:hyp} can be rewritten as 

\begin{equation}
y_{i}(\textbf{w}^{T}\textbf{x}_{i} + b) \geq 1, \text{for all $1 \leq i \leq k$}
\end{equation}

which gives an optimization problem: \\

\begin{equation}
\min_{\textbf{w},b} \dfrac{1}{2}\textbf{w}^{T}\textbf{w}
\end{equation}

subject to (for any $ i = 1,...,k $)

\begin{equation*}
y_{i}(\textbf{w}^{T}\textbf{x}_{i} + b) \geq 1
\end{equation*}

If the data is not linearly seperable it can be mapped to a higher dimensional feature space using the Kernel trick: $ K(\textbf{x}_{i},\textbf{x}_{j}) = \phi(\textbf{x}_{i})^{T}\phi(\textbf{x}_{j}) $ \\
where
\begin{equation*}
\phi(\textbf{x}_{i}) = (\phi_{1}(\textbf{x}_{i}), \phi_{2}(\textbf{x}_{i}),...)
\end{equation*}
The new equation is:

\begin{equation}
\min_{\textbf{w},b, \xi} \dfrac{1}{2}\textbf{w}^{T}\textbf{w} + C\sum_{1 = 1}^{k}\xi_{i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
\xi_{i} \geq 0, i = 1,...,k
\end{equation*}
subject to (for any $ i = 1,...,k $)

\begin{equation*}
y_{i}(\textbf{w}^{T}\phi(\textbf{x}_{i}) + b) \geq 1 - \xi_{i}
\end{equation*}
Some common kernels that will be tested during this thesis are: \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear Kernel: $K(\textbf{x}_i,\textbf{x}_{j}) = \textbf{x}_i\cdot\textbf{x}_{j}$

\item Polynomial Kernel: $K(\textbf{x}_i,\textbf{x}_{j}) = (\gamma\textbf{x}_i\cdot\textbf{x}_{j} + r)^d, \gamma > 0$

\item Gaussian Radial Basis Function: $K(\textbf{x}_i,\textbf{x}_{j}) = e^{(-\gamma\|\textbf{x}_i-\textbf{x}_{j}\|)^2}, \gamma > 0$

\item Sigmoid Kernel: $K(\textbf{x}_i,\textbf{x}_{j}) = \tanh(\gamma\textbf{x}_i\cdot\textbf{x}_{j} + r)$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Post processing}

After the classification is done some post processing might need to be implemented to clean up some of the wrongly classified objects. For example a shape based post processing can be used to remove objects that are to "perfect" from the cloud class.

\subsection{Evaluation}
When the classification is done the result needs to be evaluated to know how the algorithm performed. This will be done by comparing the classified images to a hand labeled ground truth. Some ground truth already exists, and some might need to be hand labeled during the thesis. 

\section{Time Plan}
The given task has been divided into several sub tasks to easier plan the work. The estimated time for each sub task is listed in the time plan in figure \ref{fig:timeplan} below.
Note that week 53-2 and week 11-12 are marked red because of Christmas break and exams.
